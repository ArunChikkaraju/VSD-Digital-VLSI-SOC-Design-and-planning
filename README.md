# VSD-Digital-VLSI-SOC-Design-and-planning



## DAY-1 

We will see how to do synthesis for the particular design picorv32 using the openlane flow and generate the netlist and other necessary reports after the synthesis step

* First of all,we need to make sure that the virtual machine is working
* If everything is fine we can see a terminal inside the machine like this

* We need to go to this path Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane Before doing the further steps
* Then we need to type docker command

  what is docker exactly?
  Docker is a tool that simplifies creating, deploying, and running applications in containers. For example, with OpenLane, an open-source VLSI flow, you can package the 
  entire OpenLane environment and its dependencies into a Docker container. This container ensures that OpenLane runs consistently on any machine, avoiding the hassle of 
  installing and configuring the software manually. Docker images act as blueprints for these containers, making it easy to share and replicate the setup. This guarantees a 
  smooth and consistent experience across different development stages and environments.

* so,after running the docker command we can the terminal like this
